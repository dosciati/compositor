# WordComposer - React Component

The code implements a React component called **WordComposer**, which provides an interactive interface for composing words using syllables and numbers. The primary goal is to allow users to select syllables and numbers from predefined lists and combine them to create compositions, which are dynamically displayed.

## **Main Features**

### **Initial Setup**
- The initial state is configured with lists of numbers (0-9) and syllables (vowels and common combinations of consonants and vowels, such as "BA", "BE", etc.).

### **Interactivity**
- Users can click buttons to add numbers or syllables to the composition.
- The current composition is displayed in real-time.

### **Vocalization**
- Uses the Speech Synthesis API to convert the composition into speech, allowing the composed text to be "spoken" automatically when updated or triggered by a button click.

### **Clearing and Control**
- A button allows clearing the current composition, resetting the state, and stopping any ongoing vocalization.

## **Core Idea**
The code represents an interactive educational or entertainment tool, enabling the exploration of syllable and number combinations with auditory feedback. It is particularly useful for phonetics learning activities, literacy development, or simply as a game to form words and hear their pronunciations.
